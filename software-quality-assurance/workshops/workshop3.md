## Workshop 3 

## Workshop Name: Resilient Automated Configuration Management 

## Description 

Use an existing tool to find security misconfigurations in Kubernetes configuration files 

## Targeted Courses 

Software Quality Assurance 

## Activities 

### Pre-lab Content Dissemination 

In our lecture we learned that now tools exist to mange configurations automatically. Once such tool is [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). With Kubernetes lot of clusters can be managed by automatically. Kubernetes uses configuration files called manifests that are executed using a tool called `kubectl`. These manifests are developed using a langauge called the Yet Another Markup Language, i.e., [YAML](https://yaml.org/). 

In this workshop we will use a tool called [SLI-KUBE](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/akondrahman/sli-kube) to find security misconfigurations. According to U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, (NIST)[https://www.nist.gov/], a security misconfiguration is `a setting within a computer program that violates a configuration policy or that permits unintended behavior that impacts the security posture of a system`. The goal of this workshop to understand how can we use a tool to identify security misconfigurations in Kubernetes manifests.  



### In-class Hands-on Experience 

- Go to announcements on CANVAS. See the announcemnent on `Workshop 3`
- Install Docker on your computer 
- Run the following instructions one at a time to run the tool: 
  - docker rm $(docker ps -a -f status=exited -f status=created -q) 
  - docker rmi -f $(docker images -a -q) 
  - docker pull akondrahman/sli-kube 
  - docker images -a 
  - docker run --rm -it akondrahman/sli-kube bash 
  - cd SLI-KUBE-WORK/KubeSec-master/ 
  - `python3 main.py` or `python main.py`  
- Locate the output file generated by the tool 

### Assignment 3 (Post Lab Experience) 
- Run the tool for all Kubernetes manifests zipped in `workshop3.zip` 
  - First extract the zip file 
  - Second change `main.py` so that the extracted folder gets scanned with `SLI-KUBE`. 
  - Third run `python3 main.py` or `python main.py`  
- Report the three most frequent security misocnfigurations as determined by SLI-KUBE. Your report should inlcude a 2 sentence description. Use `Section-2.3` from `workshop3-paper.pdf`. 
of three security misocnfigurations 
- Upload your report on `Assignment-3` @ CANVAS 
- Complete the [survey](https://auburn.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ekBpwjd4TkT1tpc)
