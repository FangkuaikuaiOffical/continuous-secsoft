## Instructions related to Project 
- For the graduate section a team must have at least one and at most two members. For the undergraduate section a team must have at least three and at most four members.   
- Project source code must be maintained in Tenn. Tech Gitlab repos (https://gitlab.csc.tntech.edu/). 
- Each project update will include updates so far as a Markdown file which will reside in the repo. Instructions on how to run the program must be written in a Markdown file. The required libraries needed to run code should be written.  
- Mismatch between reported output and source code results will be inspected. The instructor will download repos, install libraries, and run the code based on the instruction provided in the mentioned Markdown file. For reproducibility students are allowed to use Docker containers.   
- Throughout the semester you will be completing 3/4 tasks as part of your individual project. Each of these tasks will have a deadline. If you miss the deadline you will be penalized 5 points allocated for the project for each day of delay. 
- For sharing results and demonstrating completion of tasks you will use issues and share screenshots and links of your work. For example, if your task is to find a hard-coded password in source code, you need to share the link of the code where you found the hard-coded password. 


## Other instructions 
- Bring your own laptop for workshops. You can't work with your peer. 
- All exams are open book, one page both side handwritten cheat sheet allowed, Cheat sheets need to be submitted with exam scripts. 
- For workshop save your work in a Tenn. Tech. Gitlab repository. 
- If the instructor detects copy-paste in source code or exams then that will result in direct **F** for the course.  
- For workshops you can consult your peers but the work needs to be solo. 
- All classes are in-person. 
- Workshops are in-person as well as take home. 


## Disability Accommodation

Students with a disability requiring accommodations should contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS).  
An Accommodation Request (AR) should be completed as soon as possible, preferably by the end of the first week of the course.  
The ODS is located in the Roaden University Center, Room 112; phone 372-6119. 
For details, view the Tennessee Tech’s Policy 340 – Services for Students with Disabilities at Policy Central.


## Diversity Statement

We are diverse in many ways, and this is pivotal to build an inclusive campus community.
To me diversity refers to our identities that includes but are not limited to race, color, national origin, language,
sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic
information. In this class, we will collaboratively work to promote diversity and inclusion. We acknowledge
our imperfections while we also fully commit ourselves for creating a more inclusive environment.
