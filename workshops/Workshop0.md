# Workshop#0 : Familiarity Workshop 

## Setting up environments 

### Instructions 

Time to get ready for the course ... here are some instructions to help you.  

#### Tools 

You will need to make sure the following tools are installed: 

- Alloy 
- American Fuzzy Lop 
- Docker 
- Python 


More tools may be required later. 

#### Gitlab setup 

Use your gitlab.csc.tntech.edu to submit your project update and assignments 

You will create two branches: `project` and `workshop` 

You will add me as a collaborator 

All communications related to projects will be on Gitlab issues. I will not answer to e-mails about projects. 


All your project materials will be searched in the `project` branch. 

All workshop-related materials, if applicable will be searched in `workshop`. 


#### Docker setup 

After installing Docker you will pull the following Docker image `akondrahman/sec-soft-edu-materials`. You will use the following command: `docker pull akondrahman/sec-soft-edu-materials`.  

Next, you will run the image and create a directory called `MY_WORKSHOP_WORK`. Then, save this image to Docker Hub. You will need to create an account on DockerHub. It is free.  

For all workshops you will use this Docker image. Upon completion of classes the instructor will pull and 
examine each Docker image to see how much work was completed. Less than 50% of the completed 
work will reduce 25% of the total points.
